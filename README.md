<b>Fake News Detection</b>

<b>Overview</b>


The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable. Our project aims to use Natural Language Processing to detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles.

<b>Dataset Description</b>


train.csv: A full training dataset with the following attributes:

id: unique id for a news article

title: the title of a news article

author: author of the news article

text: the text of the article; could be incomplete

label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable

1: FAKE NEWS

0: REAL NEWS

<b>test.csv:</b>

A testing training dataset with all the same attributes at train.csv without the label.

<b>Results:</b>

I got 98% Training Accuracy and 97% Testing Accuracy .
